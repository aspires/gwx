GWx Gem: Google Weather API Wrapper
===================================
A Ruby wrapper for the Unofficial Google Weather API

NOTE: the Google Weather API is unoffical, unliscensed, and unintended for production use.
If you want to use weather in a productin environment, or even for more than jsut a few quick tests,
use the Yahoo Weather Wrapper Gem YWx (https://github.com/aspires/ywx). Usage is very similar, and
you wont get blocked for sending a larger number of requests.
