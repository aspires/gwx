GWx Gem: Google Weather API Wrapper
===================================
A Ruby wrapper for the Unofficial Google Weather API

NOTE: the Google Weather API is unoffical unliscensed, and unintended for production use.
If you want to use weather in a production environment, or even for more than just a few quick examples,
use the [Yahoo Weather Wrapper Gem, YWx](https://github.com/aspires/ywx). Usage is very similar, and
you won't get blocked for sending a larger number of requests.

About
-----

Weather data is a great way to expose new programmers to the broad functionality
of APIs. The Google Weather API, though unofficial, is quite possibly the
simplest, easiest weather data API available, making it ideal for brief
demonstrations of programming and the Ruby language.
