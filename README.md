GWx Gem: Google Weather API Wrapper
===================================
A Ruby wrapper for the Unofficial Google Weather API

NOTE: the Google Weather API is unoffical, unliscensed, and unintended for production use.
If you want to use weather in a production environment, or even for more than just a few quick examples,
use the [Yahoo Weather Wrapper Gem, YWx](https://github.com/aspires/ywx). Usage is very similar, and
you won't get blocked for sending a larger number of requests.
